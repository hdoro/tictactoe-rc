# Minimal Tic Tac Toe game

UI is built with [SvelteJS](https://svelte.dev/) and tests are run with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Develop UI
npm run dev

# Test game state logic
npm run test
```

Most of these files are boilerplate. Focus on `App.svelte` and `gameState.js`, that's the code I wrote.
